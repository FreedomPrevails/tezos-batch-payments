## Disclaimer:

Please use this script at your own risk, and to learn how such a task can be done. We have made reasonable efforts to at least never lose funds (eg by sending to the wrong place or by purging an intermediary/burner account that has funds), but this is all provided with _no warranty whatsoever_!

## Usage:

_First, review the script! Figment is trust-worthy, but don't take our word for it!_ Then either download and run, or use this magic incantation:

    bash <( curl -s https://git.io/fx17m ) --help
    
This will show the various options and how to use them. For the lazy (using `tezos-client` in the current directory), here's an example of sending a donation of 1 XTZ to [Figment's Bakery](https://figment.network/tezos/bakery) :wink::

    bash <( curl -s https://git.io/fx17m ) --transactions tz1Scdr2HsZiQjc7bHMeBbmDRXYVvdhjJbBh=1000000

## Example:

Here I'm on an Alphanet node using the docker scripts -- sending 2 addresses 1 XTZ each:

``` plain
$ bash tezos-batch-payments.bash --docker alphanet --transactions tz1fHfqyAUzgyCbXs31uEjtsZ7TYaVrNr36i=1000000,tz1QYaYj9G9B2LoNj4DGrnBr1jNpb5R6VdT6=1000000
